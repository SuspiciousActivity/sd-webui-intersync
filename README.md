# sd-webui-intersync
Extension for AUTOMATIC1111's webui, synchronize your webui on all clients

When you connect to a server with multiple clients, generating images leads to a queue.  
But what if you *wanted* to see each others images generating live, without screensharing?  
That's what this extension is for.

*(Still in very early alpha)*
